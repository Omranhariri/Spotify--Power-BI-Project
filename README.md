# Spotify--Power-BI-Project

This repository serves as a tool to showcase a personal data analytics project in which I analyze Spotify's data from 2023 to find insights.

I used this opportunity to familiarize myself with different Power BI features, including DAX, Visualizations, and many more, which allowed me to build a dynamic and engaging 1-page report.

Out of the many insights I found the top 10 streamed songs on Spotify, the sum of streams by month, and many more!
